**Algorithm**

Repeatable sets of instructions which people or machines can use to process data. Typically, algorithms are constructed by feeding data into them and adjusting variables until a desired outcome is achieved. Thanks to breakthroughs in AI such as machine learning and neural networks today machines generally do this, as they can do it far more quickly than any human.

**Artificial Intelligence**

Today’s AIs are built on concepts developed through the study and application of data science. One way to categorize the latest wave of “intelligent” machines is as machines which are capable of carrying out data science for themselves. Rather than simply process the data they are fed, in the way they are told, they can learn it and adapt to become better at processing it. This is how Google Translate becomes better at understanding language, and how autonomous cars will navigate areas they have never visited before.

**Classification**

The ability to use data (about an object, event or anything else) to determine which of a number of predetermined groups an item belongs in. For a basic example, an image recognition analysis might classify all shapes with four equal sides as squares, and all shapes with three sides as triangles.

**Clustering**

Clustering is also about grouping objects together but it differs because it is used when there are no predetermined groups. Objects (or events) are clustered together due to similarities they share and algorithms determine what that common relationship between them may be. Clustering is a data science technique which makes unsupervised learning possible.

**Data Mining**

The process of examining a set of data to determine relationships between variables which could affect outcomes – generally at large scale and by machines. Data mining is an older term used by computer scientists and in business to describe the basic function of a data scientist or a data science initiative.

**Data Set**

The entire collection of data that will be used in a particular data science initiative. In modern complex Big Data projects, it can involve many types of data gathered from different sources.

**Data Scientist**

A person who applies the scientific method of observing, recording, analysing and reporting results to understand information and use it to solve problems.

**Dimension**

Data can be stored in a database which has one dimension – a list, or two dimensions – a grid made up of rows and columns. It can also be stored in multi-dimensional databases which can take the form of a grid, with three axes, or even more complex permutations, which are not possible to relate to common geospatial objects, thanks to the power of CPU processing. More complex dimensional structures typically allow for more connections to be observed between the data objects which are being analyzed.

**Predictive Modelling**

Using data to predict the future. Rather than a crystal ball or tealeaves, data scientists use probability and statistics to determine what is most likely to happen next. The more data that is available from past events, the more likely that algorithms can give a prediction with a high probability of proving correct. Predictive modelling involves running a large number of simulated events in order to determine the variables most likely to produce a desired outcome.

**Descriptive Analytics** is the examination of data or content to answer the question “What happened?” It is typically characterized by traditional business intelligence (BI) and data visualization. 


**Machine learning** is a subset of the artificial intelligence (AI) discipline that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. (Ref: Expert AI)

**Deep learning** is a technique that falls into the machine learning discipline. It is based on artificial neural networks that are inspired by the structure of the human brain. It learns from vast amounts of data and is particularly good at finding patterns from unstructured data such as text and images.


**Diagnostic Analytics** 
It is a form of advanced analytics that examines data to answer the question “Why did it happen?” You can achieve it with the help of techniques such as data mining, statistics, and machine learning.

**Predictive Analytics** is a form of advanced analytics that examines data to answer the question “What is likely to happen?” You can achieve it with the help of techniques such as machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

**Information Design** is the practice of presenting information in a way that fosters an efficient and effective understanding of the information.

**Data Visualization** falls into the discipline of information design. It refers to the graphical representation of information using visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps. The intent is to enable decision-making with the appropriate representation of insights.
